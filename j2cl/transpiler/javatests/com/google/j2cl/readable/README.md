# Contained are ABI examples.

They document output readability and help to make sure that we do not generate
Closure compiler warnings.

Tests used for verification of output JS behavior and tests of output JS
readability are being kept separate.

These are the readability tests and they should not be executed as JS
because the line between these two styles of tests should not be
muddied. But when writing and reviewing do check build.log changes to make
sure that we do not generate Closure compiler warnings. If a new warning is
occurring and it is our mistake, fix it, otherwise file a bug with Closure.
