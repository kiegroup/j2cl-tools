"""Macro for generating j2kt_test targets for multiple test files.

Similar to gen_java_tests in third_party/bazel_common/testing/test_defs.bzl,
this macro generates a j2kt_test rule for each file in `srcs` ending in "Test.java" using
the specified deps.

Example usage:

gen_j2cl_tests(
    name = "AllTests",
    srcs = glob(["*.java"]),
)
